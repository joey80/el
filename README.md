# ExploreLearning Assignment

Build a responsive webpage that emulates the layout of icons on a smart phone home screen.  Use the attached mockup (layout.png) as a reference.  It should meet the following requirements:

* Responsive layout: screen more than 1000px: show 6 columns, 500px-999px: show 4 columns, below 500px: show 2 columns
* Icon should be draggable.  To drag an icon a user must click and hold for a second or so.
* Dragging an icon into other icons should re-order the icons on the screen. 
* Use png's for icons, 80px x 80px.  Icons should be retina ready
* Extra Credit: Add a CSS only wallpaper design.

You can use whatever libraries you want to develop this as long as it consists of HTML/CSS/JS.  You can send us a zip file of the page, or host it somewhere (such as Github), whatever works for you.
